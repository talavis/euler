'''Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle T_n=n(n+1)/2 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
Pentagonal P_n=n(3nâˆ’1)/2 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
Hexagonal H_n=n(2nâˆ’1) 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...
It can be verified that T_285 = P_165 = H_143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.'''
